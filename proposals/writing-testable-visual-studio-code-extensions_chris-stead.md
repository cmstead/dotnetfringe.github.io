Writing Testable Visual Studio Code Extensions
==============================================

* Speaker   : *Chris Stead*
* Available : *July 10-12* 
* Length    : *~30 minutes*

Description
-----------

We will walk through creating a simple Visual Studio Code extension and integrating testing throughout the entire
process. We will take a look at using approval tests to guarantee all changes are not only checked at git commit time
but also at test time.  We will also use the factory pattern and the Mockery library to break dependency on the vscode
module so integration points are testable.
